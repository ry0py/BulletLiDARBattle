# Hot Reload Troubleshooting

## Reading `--status` and `InvocationCount`

`uloop hot-reload --status` lists the methods whose bodies are currently replaced and the
members hot reload added, without applying or reverting anything. It cannot be combined
with `--files` or `--revert-all`. Patches are static Editor state, so the answer is authoritative: after
a domain reload it reports zero patched methods, which is exactly when an
`ActivePatchTotal` remembered from an earlier response has gone stale.

Each `Active` row's `InvocationCount` counts calls into the patched body since that patch
was applied. Reloading the same source with no edits after a fully applied reload (a run
with no Skipped or Failed outcomes) reports `AlreadyActive` and the row carries
the live `InvocationCount`, unless another edited file of the same assembly is in the
reload — then the unchanged file is re-applied with that group; re-running after a real edit replaces the patch and resets it to zero. When `InvocationCount` is 0 on an `Active` row, `Reason` notes that the method has not run since this patch was applied: calls that already finished do not re-run, and the patched body takes effect the next time this method is called. For initialization-only methods it also names how to trigger that next call.

Each `Added` row's `InvocationCount` counts calls into the added member's body the same
way, from a counter of the member's own: an unchanged reload's `AlreadyActive` row for it
carries that count, and re-applying the member — by editing it, or by re-applying its file
with an edited file of the same assembly — starts the count over at zero. Compiled code
cannot call an added member, so the count stays 0 until a hot-reloaded body that calls it
runs, or, for a forwarded Unity message, until the hot-reload proxy delivers the message in
Play Mode; `Reason` says so while the count is 0. An added iterator counts when its
enumeration starts rather than when it is called.

While Unity is paused — including while a pause-point hit holds the game — the player loop
does not advance, so game-driven calls stop and the count freezes; calls you make yourself (for
example through `uloop execute-dynamic-code`) still increment it. A frozen count during a
pause only means game-driven calls are not running; it says nothing about whether call
sites reach the patch. Resume first
(`uloop control-play-mode --action Resume`, or clear the owning pause point), drive the
game, and only then read `InvocationCount` as a reachability signal.

## When a Patch Reports `Patched` but Behavior Does Not Change

Run `uloop get-logs` first. An exception thrown inside the patched body, or an
error logged while the reload applied, appears there immediately and explains
"Patched but no visible change" faster than any marker-based digging.

`Patched` means the method body was replaced, not that the method ran. Before suspecting
the patch, confirm the method is actually reached: arm `uloop enable-pause-point --mode
trace` on a line inside the edited method body — it resolves against the patched body
directly (see [pause-point-interaction.md](pause-point-interaction.md)) — drive the game, and check the hit
count: zero hits usually means the calling path never reached the method, which no patch
(or compile) can fix — but cached dispatch (a physics message or a pre-bound delegate
resolved before arming) can bypass the marker, so treat zero hits as inconclusive there
and use the log-line fallback in [pause-point-interaction.md](pause-point-interaction.md). To chase an early return inside the method, arm a second marker on the
suspected early-return line. The other known cause is JIT inlining, which the response flags
with a single aggregated warning listing the at-risk methods: `[AggressiveInlining]` methods
always, tiny bodies only when the Editor's Code Optimization mode is Release (the default
Debug mode does not inline them). If `uloop hot-reload --status` shows the method's
`InvocationCount` increasing, the calls you exercised are reaching the patched body and the
warning did not apply to them — call sites you have not exercised may still run inlined old
code. Take both readings while the code is actually being driven — PlayMode running, or your own
`uloop execute-dynamic-code` invocation for Editor-assembly methods; a count frozen during
a pause is not evidence either way.

## Stack Traces From Patched Methods

A frame printed as `(wrapper dynamic-method) …` never carries a location, and a patched
method prints as one: its body runs as a dynamic method, so its frame reads
`(wrapper dynamic-method) MonoMod.Utils.DynamicMethodDefinition.<Type>.<Method>_Patch<n>(…)`,
and the next frame with `(at <file>:<line>)` is its caller, not the failing statement.
Frames from the shim assembly (a type named `<Type>_UloopHotReloadShims_<n>`, a method
named `<Method>__shim<n>`) do carry the edited file and line. They appear above the
patched frame, for instance when the patch forwards the body to its shim or the body calls
a method a reload added (`Added` rows); the topmost of them names the failing statement.

When no shim frame sits above the `_Patch<n>` frame, the failing statement is in that
patched body, or in a call it made that left no frame of its own. Arm
`uloop enable-pause-point --file <edited file> --line <N> --mode trace` on lines inside the
edited body — such a line arms the patched body directly (see
[pause-point-interaction.md](pause-point-interaction.md)) — drive the code again, and read
the hits with `uloop pause-point-status`: the failing statement sits at or after the last
marked line that records a hit, and before the first one that records none. A line inside
an added method cannot hold a pause point until `uloop compile`, so mark the line that
calls it instead.

## When Earlier Patches Still Call an Added Member That Is Gone

A patched or added body keeps calling the added members it was applied against. When a later
reload changes such a member's signature, deletes it, or reports it `Skipped`, the member is
no longer registered and `--status` stops listing it, but a caller that did not apply again
in that reload — its row is `Failed` or `Skipped`, or its file was not re-applied — still
runs the member's earlier body, which matches neither the compiled assembly nor the source
on disk. `Warnings` then carries one line naming each such call as `<Caller> calls <Member>`,
with `<Member>` in the signature the caller was applied against.

The line comes back on every reload that includes the caller's file or the member's file,
and stops once the caller applies again: fix what the caller's row reported and reload its
file together with the member's file, or run `uloop compile`. A reload that includes neither
file does not repeat it.
