# Hot Reload Scope and Limits

Only ordinary method declarations and property getters with a body are patched. A
property added to a compiled type applies as an added member instead (see below).
Constructors, operators, and explicit event accessors are reported as `Skipped`
when edited (with a verified baseline, unchanged members of those kinds produce
no row). Finalizers and `interface` members (including default interface
implementations) are never scanned: **edits** to them produce **no per-method
entry at all** and are silently not applied — use `uloop compile` for those.
Adding a constructor, operator, or explicit event accessor is reported as
`Skipped` as well, same as an edit to an existing one.

## Added methods and fields

Hot reload can add new methods and fields alongside body edits, under one hard rule:
an added member is visible only to edited code in the same reload, within the same
compiled assembly. Files that compile into one assembly are reloaded together through
one shim assembly, so a body edited in one of them can call a member added in another
— pass the declaring file and its callers to the same command. Compiled, unedited
code cannot see it, and neither can anything that resolves members by name at
runtime: reflection (`GetType().GetMethod("NewM")` returns `null`), Unity's message
discovery (see "Added Unity messages" below), the Unity Test Runner (an added `[Test]` /
`[UnityTest]` method is not enumerated by `uloop run-tests --skip-compile` — a
`Warnings` entry names it; run `uloop compile` first), UnityEvent/inspector wiring, and
serialization. Referencing an added member from a file that is neither passed to this reload nor
already hot-reloaded, or from another assembly, fails that file's hot reload with
the usual new-member hint; run `uloop compile` instead. Unchanged files of the same
assembly that already hold active patches are re-applied automatically so they bind
to the newest shim. An edited body that reaches an added method through a
compiled type still binds when the receiver's static type name, method name, and
argument count uniquely match and the call is static only when the receiver is a
type name; the lookup uses that static type itself (not a base type), requires an
exact argument count, and does not cover `?.`.

An added method reports its own row with Kind `Added`; the edited methods that call
it report `Patched` as usual. Added `virtual`/`override`/`abstract` methods, explicit
interface implementations, and generic methods are `Skipped`; a method-group or
delegate reference to an added instance method skips the referencing method instead.
A private member added in the same reload is reached directly, not through an accessor
delegate: a body may read or write an added private static property and call an added
private method with `ref`/`out` arguments. A *compiled* private or internal static property
can also be read, assigned, and compound-assigned (through accessor delegates), but a call
to a *compiled* private method with `ref`/`out` arguments still skips the method (see the
`Skipped` table below).
Pause points cannot bind to lines inside an added method — enabling one there is
refused with a message naming the added method (see
[pause-point-interaction.md](pause-point-interaction.md)).

An added field's values live in a side table that follows each instance's lifetime
(statics live per domain). Its initializer does not run at construction time; it runs
on the field's first access from edited code — once per instance, or once per domain
for statics. Initializer expressions are limited to what a static lambda on a separate
shim type can evaluate: literals, externally visible static calls (`= 5`,
`= Math.Abs(x)`), and array creation whose elements are themselves such expressions
(`= new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }`). Object creation (`= new List<int>()`) and anything touching
the host type or instance state skips the field's readers and writers with a per-method
reason — including an array element that is itself a refused object creation. The one
object creation that applies is a type an
earlier reload introduced and this Editor session still keeps active, through a
constructor the retained assembly holds as `public` — including in the reload that also
edits a body of that type. A constructor this reload adds to it, or one whose parameters
the retained assembly does not hold, keeps the readers and writers `Skipped`.
Because the initializer runs on first access, one this reload adds to — or changes on — a
field an earlier reload already added never reaches a value the side table already holds:
it runs only where the field has not been read yet. That reload names those fields in
`Warnings`; the way to reach the existing instances is to assign the value inside a patched
method, rename the field, or run `uloop compile`.
To apply such a field without compiling, declare it
without an initializer — it starts at `default(T)` — and assign it inside the patched
method instead; for a reference type, guard that with
`if (_field == null) { _field = new List<int>(); }`. `??=` is not rewritable and keeps
the method `Skipped`. So do the other writes the store rewrite cannot carry: a
deconstruction into the field (`(_field, other) = pair;` — assign it in its own statement
`_field = value;` instead), an assignment whose value is consumed, a receiver that would be
evaluated twice, and a write to a member of a value-type added field or an instance method
call on it (copy the field into a local, change the local, and assign it back). When every
method that assigns such a field is `Skipped` but a
method that reads it was applied, a `Warnings` entry names the field, the skipped
writers and the reader: the reader sees `default(T)`. Fix the skip reason and reload
again, or run `uloop compile`. Accessors of properties added in the same edit count as
readers and writers too: an applied getter is a reader, and a skipped setter is a skipped
writer. An added auto-property without an initializer gets the same check, with a warning
that starts `Added auto-property`. Added `const` values are folded into edited bodies as literals,
like `nameof`. Pause-point
`CapturedVariables` never includes added fields; `enable-pause-point` warns when the
resolved type has any — their values live in the hot-reload shim, and a
`uloop execute-dynamic-code` snippet cannot name them as members (it compiles against
the compiled assembly, so that fails with CS1061). Read one there with
`HotReloadAddedFieldWiring.TryReadInstanceField` (`TryReadStaticField` for a static
field) instead. When such a
failure quotes the name of an active added member, the diagnostic's `Hint` says so
rather than leaving the error reading as a typo. Naming the field is what fails, not
reaching it: an `execute-dynamic-code` snippet can still read and write an added field
by name through the wiring entry point, which is how a value or scene reference gets
into an added `[SerializeField]` without a compile — see
[added-field-wiring.md](added-field-wiring.md).

A type a reload introduces can call added members of a compiled type from its ordinary
methods and get-only properties: its artifact compiles those bodies as stubs, and the same
reload patches the real bodies in. From a constructor, initializer, setter, indexer,
operator or event accessor such a reference still fails with CS1061/CS0117 and needs a
compile — see [introduced-types.md](introduced-types.md).

Added members are an Editor-session illusion. Any real compile or domain reload
drops them all: added methods disappear from the ledger and added-field values are
discarded — they do not migrate into the compiled field's initializer semantics.
Deleting an added member from the edit and re-applying (or reverting the file to its
compiled source) removes it from the ledger on that run. Deleting a *compiled*
member is reported in `Warnings`, but its IL remains callable from unedited code
until `uloop compile`.

Adding a constructor, operator, or explicit event accessor is still out of
scope and is reported as `Skipped`, same as edits to them. With a verified
baseline, event declarations are compared per accessor, so only the edited
add or remove appears as a `Skipped` row. A newly added explicit event, or
an edit before the first compile snapshot, still reports both accessors.
Adding a type
(`class`, `struct`, `enum`, `record`), an event, or an indexer is still out of scope.
A member added to a compiled enum is out of scope too: it is not folded like an added
`const`, so every body that names it fails with CS0117, including bodies in the same
reload. Write the underlying value as a cast (`(MyEnum)3`) or run `uloop compile`.
While the enum's file is in the reload, an added member that passes the enum to or takes
it from compiled code or an introduced type is skipped. The `Skipped` row names the step
for that run (pass a file, leave the enum file out, undo the edit and leave it out, or
compile), chosen from whether the file was passed, carried in, or already holds patches.
This holds for a type the reload introduces as well: its compile fails, the failure
reason says the name is an enum member this reload adds, and the enum-member and
changed-`const` warnings of the files passed to that reload stay in `Warnings` even though
that failure stops the file. The drift of a changed sibling file that was not passed is not
reported on this failure path.
When `--files` is omitted and the enum's file has no edit besides its new enum members,
the reload leaves that file out instead, so the added members of the other files apply;
a `Warnings` line names the left-out file and the enum members that still need
`uloop compile`. A file that already holds patches or declares a new type stays in the
reload.

An added property applies unless its shape is listed below. A bodied getter or setter is
emitted like an added method;
an auto-property is emitted as a pair of accessors over the added-field store, so its
value follows the same lifetime as an added field and appears in `--status` as one
`Added` row per accessor plus one `AddedField` row for the value — three rows for a
get/set auto-property, two for a getter-only one. The rows read
`Ns.Type.get_X()`, `Ns.Type.set_X(System.Int32)`, and `Ns.Type.X`. The added-fields lifetime warning covers it. Accessors are not
pause points, and the value never appears in `CapturedVariables`.

These property shapes stay `Skipped` with a per-member reason: a setter without a
getter, `virtual`/`override`/`abstract`/interface, an explicit interface
implementation, an `init` accessor, a host that is a `struct` or a generic type, a value type
the shim assembly cannot see or cannot resolve, an auto-property initializer that
creates an object or touches the host's own members, and a name the compiled assembly
already declares as a field or an event. Edited callers are skipped too when they use a
shape the accessor shim cannot carry: compound assignment or increment, an assignment
whose value is consumed, a deconstruction target, an object initializer, a property
pattern that matches the property, `nameof`, `ref`/`out`/`in`, and conditional access
on the property itself. A compound assignment or increment keeps hot reloading when it is
rewritten as a plain assignment statement (`X = X + 1;`).

Types, events, and indexers are not reported per member — no `Skipped` row names them;
at most they surface as outside-body drift in `Warnings`. Treat their silence
as "not applied" and land them with `uloop compile`.

Outside method bodies, only member additions (previous section) take effect.
Every other declaration edit — changing a `const` value, a compiled field's
initializer, an attribute — leaves runtime behavior unchanged even though the
response reports `Success` — shims resolve those symbols
against the already-compiled assembly, and C# bakes `const` values into IL at compile
time. Changed `const` values (including enum member values) are detected and reported
as a `Warnings` entry naming the constant and both values. The scan includes
changed sibling files in the same assembly, not only the file passed to
`--files`. When a verified source
baseline is available (next paragraph), other outside-body drift — existing-field
initializers, attributes, and other declaration edits — is reported as a `Warnings`
entry as well (handled added members and reported removed members are excluded
from this generic warning); without a baseline it stays silent. Either way, use
`uloop compile` for such edits.

## Signature changes: return type, rename, parameters

Changing a compiled method's return type is applied as a remove-plus-add: the old
method stays in the compiled assembly (like any removed member), the new signature
becomes an added method with its own `Added` row, and the edited methods that call
it report `Patched`. Every added-member rule applies — same-reload visibility within
the assembly, the Editor-session illusion, and the `virtual`/generic/interface
exclusions.

A gate protects compiled callers: the change applies only when every live compiled
call site of the old signature is in the same assembly and patched by the same reload.
A caller this reload did not edit — in another file or an *unedited* method in the
edited file itself (an implicit `int`→`long` widening can leave a caller's source
untouched) — would keep calling the old method silently, so the run reports the
changed method and its edited callers as `Skipped` instead; land the change with
`uloop compile`. A caller in another assembly gates the change even when this or an
earlier reload patched it: that patch is compiled against the compiled assembly, where
the old signature still exists. When every uncovered caller is in the edited file itself, the
`Skipped` reason names those callers: editing their bodies and reloading again
applies them together without `uloop compile`.
Call sites inside methods that the same edit removes or
re-signatures do not gate: those compiled bodies are already stale, and anything
still reaching them stays on the consistent old behavior.
If an earlier reload already patched the compiled call sites in the same assembly, a later signature change applies without editing the callers; the response then carries a warning naming the call sites this run re-applied on the new signature.

Renaming a method or changing its parameter list follows the delete rules rather
than the gate: the new signature is an ordinary added method, the old one is
reported removed, and a `Warnings` entry names each compiled call site of the old
signature that the reload leaves unpatched — those call sites keep the previous
behavior until `uloop compile`. Deleting a method emits the same warning when
compiled callers remain. A caller whose patch is active when the reload ends —
patched by this reload in any assembly, or kept from an earlier reload — is left out,
because it no longer runs its compiled body. The warning does not check what the
patched body calls, and two leftovers of the compiled caller can still reach the old
method: a copy the JIT inlined into another method before the patch, and a delegate to
the old method the caller created before it. A call inside a lambda or local function
stays listed under its compiler-generated name even when the method declaring it is
patched.
An added member that a later reload re-signatures or deletes has no compiled callers, but a
hot-reloaded caller that does not apply again in that reload keeps calling the member's
earlier body; `Warnings` then names that call (see [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)).

Field declarations are stricter: when a compiled field's type — or its `static`/
`const` modifier — differs from the edited source, every edited method that reads
or writes that field is `Skipped` with a per-method reason. Retyped storage has no
session illusion; run `uloop compile`.

## Explore with hot reload, land structure with compile

Treat hot reload as the exploration phase and `uloop compile` as the landing phase. While
diagnosing or tuning, keep every edit inside existing method bodies — inline a would-be
helper's logic at its call site for now instead of extracting it. New helper methods
and fields can now be explored directly with hot reload, across the files of one
assembly: pass the files you edited; unchanged files that already hold active
patches are re-applied with that group. A top-level class, struct, enum, or interface declared `public`, `internal`,
or without an access modifier in an edited file is introduced by that reload too, and can use the
assembly's internal members (`introduced-types.md`). When the change needs
another new-type shape, visibility from another assembly or from a file outside the reload,
runtime name-based lookup, or serialization, collect those and run `uloop compile` once: every compile triggers a domain reload that drops all active patches and pause points
and resets the running PlayMode session, so compiling member-by-member pays that cost
repeatedly. After the one compile, re-enter PlayMode and continue exploring on the freshly
compiled code.

## Added Unity messages

Unity finds a `MonoBehaviour`'s messages by name on the compiled class, so a message a
reload added is not one the engine knows about. While Play Mode runs, hot reload stands a
generated proxy component next to each live instance of the target type and forwards the
message from there, so an added `Update`, `OnTriggerEnter`, or `OnMouseDown` does run. The
method's row says which answer it got in `LifecycleNote` (see Output).

- Forwarded: `Start`, `Update`, `LateUpdate`, `FixedUpdate`, `OnGUI`, the collision, trigger,
  and mouse messages (2D included), and the application/pause/focus messages. `Update`,
  `LateUpdate`, `FixedUpdate`, and `OnGUI` are forwarded only while the target itself is
  active and enabled; the event messages are forwarded as they arrive.
- Not forwarded, and listed together in one `Warnings` line: `Awake`, `OnEnable`,
  `OnDisable`, `OnDestroy`, the editor-only messages (`Reset`, `OnValidate`,
  `OnDrawGizmos`, `OnDrawGizmosSelected`), and any message declared with a return value or a
  `ref`/`out` parameter. Run `uloop compile` to have the engine dispatch those.
  When such a message's body is also skipped for a private access with no accessor rewrite,
  its `Skipped` row names `uloop compile` as the only step: no rewrite of the body would make
  the engine call it.

The proxies exist only for the running session: nothing is attached outside Play Mode, and a
compile or a domain reload drops them along with every other patch. Execution order relative
to other components is not guaranteed — a proxy is its own component, so an added `Update`
does not run at the position the compiled one would. The reconcile that attaches proxies
scans the open scenes for instances of the target types on each editor update, which costs a
`FindObjectsByType` per bound type; it does nothing at all while no added message is active.

## One-shot code: a patch only changes the next call

Hot reload changes what a method does on its *next* call — it never re-runs a call that
already happened. Methods that run exactly once per session (`Awake`, `Start`, `OnEnable`,
initialization helpers called from them, anything that seeds state at startup) patch
successfully but show no effect: the one call they get is already in the past when the
patch lands. An *added* `Start` is the exception, and only because it is not a patch at all:
the proxy that carries it runs it once on each instance that already exists, at the moment
the proxy attaches. A later reload that only changes method bodies keeps the attached proxies,
so `Start` does not run again; it does when the reload changes which messages the type adds or
their signatures, because the proxy is rebuilt. The response marks these with `LifecycleNote` (see Output) — both direct one-shot
lifecycle messages and methods whose every compiled caller is a one-shot lifecycle message on a
`MonoBehaviour`. The caller check is conservative: when the scan cannot prove exclusivity (a
missing assembly, reflection, or event-driven calls), the note is omitted. Only compiled callers
are counted: a method hot reload added or patched that calls the method already runs the patched
body, which the note does not see. To see an
initialization change take effect, run `uloop compile` and restart
Play Mode — with Domain Reload enabled (the default for projects created before Unity 6.6), a fresh Play entry reloads the
domain and drops the patch, so the patched body alone cannot carry the change into the
next session. Better, keep values you expect to
tune out of one-shot paths entirely: read them in a body that runs per frame or per event,
and patch that body instead.

## Tunable values: prefer a getter over a const

`const` edits never take effect through hot reload: C# bakes const values into every
call site at compile time. When you expect to tune a value while Play Mode is running
(speeds, amplitudes, sensitivities), expose it as a static property getter instead —
adding one in the same edit works, so the getter does not have to exist yet:

    public static float HeightAmplitude => 5f;

A getter body is an ordinary patchable method body, so editing the literal and running
`uloop hot-reload` updates every consumer on its next call — across all files, without
restarting Play Mode. JIT-inlined call sites are the exception — the reload response's
`Warnings` lists the at-risk methods (see [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)).
Keep `const` for values you never tune at runtime.

Add the getter under a new name rather than replacing an already compiled `const` with a
getter of the same name: to the compiled assembly that name is still a field, so the edit
is `Skipped` and the old constant keeps being inlined. Leave the `const` in place, add
`HeightAmplitudeValue` (or any unused name) beside it, and point the call sites at it.

This works only for consumers that read the getter on a live call path — a per-frame
`Update`, a physics step, an event handler. A consumer that read the getter once during
initialization and cached the value in a field never observes the new value: the patch
lands, but nothing reads the getter again (the one-shot rule above).

Each `uloop compile` also establishes a per-assembly source baseline: a snapshot of
the sources exactly as they were compiled, captured after the compile's domain reload
and adopted only once it verifies against the compiled assembly's PDB checksums. With
a baseline, hot reload patches only the methods whose bodies actually changed;
unchanged methods are left untouched and counted in `UnchangedTotal` (formatting,
comments, and line-ending differences count as unchanged). A run where every method
is unchanged succeeds with nothing patched.
Convergence works in both directions: a currently patched method whose body matches
the baseline again is unpatched on that run — the compiled IL comes back,
`ActivePatchTotal` drops, and its pause-point block lifts.
Without a baseline — for example before
the first compile after installing or updating the package — every editable method in
the file is patched and a `Warnings` line reports the fallback; run `uloop compile`
to establish the baseline. Files the reload only re-applied as siblings share one
such line per reason, `N re-applied sibling file(s) ...: <files>`, instead of one
line each. A file with a declaration that hot reload refused to introduce (its
`Warnings` line says the type requires a compile) gets no such line, because that
compile also establishes its baseline. This also holds for an existing file that
gains such a declaration, for example a nested type or a delegate.

Property getters with a body (including expression-bodied properties) are patched
like ordinary methods. Editing a compiled property's setter, init, or indexer accessor
is reported per-accessor as `Skipped`, so an edited accessor never disappears from the
response silently; with a verified baseline, accessors unchanged from it produce no
row. A property *added* in this edit is different: both of its accessors apply (see
"Added members" above).

Subscribing to or unsubscribing from a field-like event (`+=`/`-=`) inside an edited
body works, and so does raising or reading one (`E?.Invoke(x)`, `E(x)`,
`if (E != null)`, `E = null`): the shim reads the event's backing field through a
Harmony accessor, which puts that method on the delegation path. Four shapes have no
backing field to reach and stay `Skipped` (see the table below): an event with custom
`add`/`remove` accessors, an `abstract`/`extern`/interface event, an event whose
delegate type is not visible outside the assembly, and an event added in this edit
(including one that had custom accessors when the assembly was last compiled).
Raising through a conditional receiver (`other?.E?.Invoke(x)`) and `nameof(E)` also
stay `Skipped`.
Subscribing to an event added in this edit, in any file of the run, is `Skipped`
too, whether the handler is a method group or a lambda: the compiled assembly has no
such event for the subscription to bind to until `uloop compile`.

A `Skipped` row never undoes what an earlier reload applied to the same method: that
patch keeps running, so the method matches neither the compiled assembly nor the
source on disk. When a run skips a method it had patched before, `Warnings` names it.

## Skipped — reported per method and in `Warnings`, never flips `Success`

| Condition | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Method on a `partial` type (including a type nested inside a partial outer type) | A single file cannot provide a complete semantic model |
| Method on a struct (value type) | Value-type patching is out of scope |
| Generic method, or method on a generic type | Harmony cannot safely patch open generics |
| Explicit interface implementation | Dotted metadata names cannot be expressed as shim identifiers |
| No body (`abstract` / `extern`) | Nothing to transplant |
| Body contains a `base.` call | `base` cannot be expressed from outside the type |
| Private/internal access inside an async/iterator/closure body has no accessor-delegate shape | Conditional access (`?.`), `??=`, indexers, static field writes, initializer member assignments, compound writes whose receiver could be evaluated twice, assignments whose value is consumed, deconstructions that set a property through a private/internal setter, and calls with `ref`/`out`/`in`, named, optional, or `params` arguments (or to extension/generic/by-ref-returning methods) cannot be rewritten to accessor delegates. Neither can ref-returning properties. These limits apply to compiled members; a `ref`/`out` method added in the same reload is reached directly. A compiled private/internal static property can be read, assigned, and compound-assigned |
| An async/iterator/closure body references a private/internal type | Accessor delegates rescue member access, not type references; the body still cannot JIT-compile from the shim assembly |
| A declared return or parameter type cannot be resolved (a new type this reload could not introduce, a missing using, or a typo) | Skipped; a supported new type declared in an edited file of the same assembly is introduced by this reload, so check `Warnings` for the refusal reason (`introduced-types.md`); otherwise add the type or the `using`, or fix the typo, then run `uloop compile` |
| An added member's body cannot be fully bound in the hot-reload compilation | Hot reload cannot verify a member it cannot bind. A common cause: another file of the same reload, passed or pulled back in because it holds active patches, declares a compiled type from source, while a compiled API the body calls still names the compiled copy (for example, a lambda handed to a compiled `Register(Action<T>)`). The reason then names both types and the file declaring the compiled API. When the called member belongs to a type an earlier reload introduced and its signature was bound to the compiled copy, the reason names the introduced type and that compiled type instead. Either way the `Skipped` row names the step for that run (pass the file declaring the compiled API, leave the file declaring the type out, undo its edit and leave it out, or `uloop compile`), chosen from whether each file was passed, carried in, or already holds patches; a row about an added property's body points to the row of its accessor instead. A file passed this way is brought back by every later reload of the assembly while it stays unchanged, including the reload that re-applies after `--revert-all` or Play entry, until the next successful compile. When the skip deactivated added members an earlier reload applied, the next reload of the assembly retries their unchanged file once, so passing only the declaring file applies them again |
| Edited setter, init, or indexer accessor of a *compiled* property | Accessor patching covers getters only; `uloop compile` applies these edits. Accessors of a property added in this edit are emitted instead |
| Constructor (instance or static), operator, conversion operator, or explicit event accessor (add/remove) | Skipped; `uloop compile` applies these edits |
| Method raises or reads a field-like event that has no reachable backing field | Custom `add`/`remove` accessors, an `abstract`/`extern`/interface event, a delegate type that is not visible outside the assembly, or an event added in this edit leave nothing for the shim's Harmony accessor to bind |
| Method raises or reads a field-like event through a conditional receiver (`other?.E`) | The shim has no name for the conditional receiver to pass to the accessor call |
| Method names a field-like event inside `nameof` | The shim is a different type and cannot keep the bare event name |
| Method subscribes (`+=`/`-=`) to an event added in this edit | The shim binds the subscription against the compiled assembly, which has no such event yet |

## Failed — flips `Success` to `false`

| Condition | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| File does not belong to any compiled assembly | Per-file entry with `Method` = `(file)`; only `Assets/` and `Packages/` sources resolve |
| Resolved assembly name is missing from CompilationPipeline | Per-file entry with `Method` = `(file)`; Unity may have mapped a not-yet-imported `.asmdef` onto a predefined assembly. Run `uloop compile` first |
| Script is not in the last compiled assembly's source list and its assembly membership cannot be confirmed | Per-file entry with `Method` = `(file)`; a new file passed with `--files` is hot-reloadable when its membership in an existing, unchanged compiled assembly is confirmed (`.asmdef` / `.asmref` boundaries are checked when present; a predefined assembly with none also passes), but fails when the Editor is not ready or an `.asmdef` / `.asmref` on its path was added, deleted, or changed since the last import — run `uloop compile` first |
| Loaded assembly differs from the one on disk (pending compile) | Run `uloop compile` first, then retry |
| Source file fails to parse | Per-file `Failed` entry with `Method` = `(file)` carrying the parse errors; nothing from that file is applied, its earlier patches stay active, and `Success` is false |
| Method signature not found in the loaded assembly | Usually a stale assembly; run `uloop compile`. In-file renames and signature changes are classified as added members before reaching this point |
| Shim compile error (e.g. the body calls a member that does not exist yet) | The error is attributed to the file it came from: that file reports `Failed` with its own compiler errors (plus the `uloop compile` hint when they indicate a missing member) and the rest of the file is `Skipped`, while the other files of the assembly are recompiled without it and applied. Bodies elsewhere that call an added method this reload left out — its shim failed to compile, or another method of its file did — are `Skipped` with a reason naming that method; its own row says which. When errors cannot be attributed to a file, every file of that assembly reports one `(shim-compile)` entry; if only one method was edited, the failure is attributed to that method's name instead |
| Patch rejected or crashed at apply time (e.g. `[BurstCompile]`, a patch-engine emit failure) | The entry carries the rejection reason or the underlying engine error |
| Accessor binding failed for a shim type | The source references a member the compiled assembly does not have yet; every delegation-patched method in that shim type reports the binder error — run `uloop compile` and retry |
| The signature-change gate could not finish the run safely — the retry that skips a gated change failed, or shim-compile isolation dropped an edited caller that had covered a change | Every file of that assembly reports `Method` = `(signature-change-gate)` carrying the specific cause; nothing from those files is applied, because the reload has no retry budget left to split them — fix the failing edit or run `uloop compile`. Files of other assemblies in the same command are unaffected |

A reload applies each file all-or-nothing: when any method in a file fails to compile or validate, nothing from that file is applied and patches from earlier reloads stay active. The other files of the same assembly are still applied, except a body that calls an added method the reload left out, whether its own shim failed to compile or another method of its file did — that body is `Skipped` until the method applies. The one exception to all-or-nothing is a Harmony patch-engine failure in the middle of applying a validated file; that run reports itself as partially applied and recommends 'uloop hot-reload --revert-all'. A `Failed` row in `IntroducedTypes` widens the unit from the file to the assembly: type preparation runs once per assembly before any of its method bodies is transformed, so every file sharing that assembly is left unapplied, while files in other assemblies still apply.
