# Wiring a value into an added field

A field a reload added has no compiled storage: its values live in a side table, and it is
invisible to the Inspector until `uloop compile`. Nothing serializes into it, so an added
`[SerializeField] GameObject _target;` starts at `default(T)` (or at its initializer value when
the declaration has one) for every instance. The run that
first makes such a field active says so in one `Warnings` line naming `Namespace.Type.field`;
later reloads of the same field stay quiet.

To put a value or a scene reference in it without compiling, call the wiring entry point from
`uloop execute-dynamic-code`. The reading shim picks the value up on the next access.

## Recipe

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using io.github.hatayama.UnityCliLoop.ToolContracts;

Enemy enemy = Object.FindObjectOfType<Enemy>();
GameObject target = GameObject.Find("Player");

HotReloadAddedFieldWiring.SetInstanceField(enemy, "_target", target);

HotReloadAddedFieldWiring.TryReadInstanceField(enemy, "_target", out object wired);
Debug.Log("wired: " + wired);
```

A static added field is wired through its type instead:

```csharp
HotReloadAddedFieldWiring.SetStaticField(typeof(Enemy), "_shared", target);
HotReloadAddedFieldWiring.TryReadStaticField(typeof(Enemy), "_shared", out object shared);
```

The field name is the name as written in the edited source. The declaring type comes from the
instance, and a field a base class declares is reached through a derived instance.

Do not read a wired field from an added `Start`. Its row says `The added Start runs once on each
existing instance when the proxy attaches.`, and the proxy attaches during the reload, before any
wiring script can run, so that `Start` sees the field's default. Put that initialization in
`Update` behind a first-use check instead.

## What it refuses, and why that matters

Every check runs before anything is stored, so a refused call leaves an earlier wiring intact.

| Situation | What happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| Field name no active reload added | Throws, listing the added fields that type does have |
| Type has no added fields at all | Throws, saying so and that a reload has to run first |
| Name of a compiled field of the type or a base type | Throws, saying it is an ordinary field to read or set like any other |
| Value the field's declared type would not accept | Throws, naming the declared type and the type passed |
| A widening numeric (`int` into a `long` field) | Throws: the reader compares with `is`, so cast first (said only when both types are numeric) |
| A `GameObject` into a `Component`-typed field | Throws, suggesting `gameObject.GetComponent<T>()` |
| A `Component` into a `GameObject` field | Throws, suggesting `component.gameObject` |
| `null` into a non-nullable value-type field | Throws |
| Static field through an instance, or the reverse | Throws, naming the call to use instead |
| A destroyed `UnityEngine.Object` as the instance | Throws: its patched methods never run again |

The try-read calls refuse the same way for every row that is about the field or the instance
rather than the value: on a type with no added fields, or after a `uloop compile`, they throw
instead of returning `false`.

`TryReadInstanceField` / `TryReadStaticField` return `false` until the field's slot exists. A
patched method that reads the field creates the slot with the field's initializer value (or its
default), so after such a read they return `true` with that value even though nothing was wired.
The try-read calls themselves never fill the slot — when no patched method has read the field
yet, it still runs its initializer on the next access.

## Do not call the low-level store directly

`HotReloadAddedFieldStore` is the gateway the generated shims call on every field access. Its
slots are untyped, so it accepts a misspelled key, a value of the wrong type, and a
static/instance mix-up in silence. A wrong-typed value is the worst case: the next read finds
a type it cannot use and replaces it with the field's initializer, so the wiring looks like it
never happened. Use the wiring entry point, which refuses all of those.

## Wired values are not durable

The side table belongs to the current domain and the current reload, and re-running the script is
not enough on its own: `uloop compile`, a domain reload, and `--revert-all` all drop the field's
*declaration* as well, and the wiring call then refuses with

```
'_target' is not an added field of <Type>, which has no active added fields at all. Run a hot
reload that adds the field first; a compile, a domain reload, or 'uloop hot-reload --revert-all'
drops the added fields.
```

So the recovery order is always **re-apply the hot reload first, then re-run the wiring script**.
`uloop hot-reload` with no `--files` re-selects the files changed since the last compile, which is
usually the one you want; it works while play mode is running. A new file that declares a type hot
reload introduced is never a changed file, but after entering play mode or `--revert-all` it is
selected again too, so the field it declares comes back with the rest.
The `--revert-all` response's `Warnings` names the added fields it dropped, and the re-apply that
adds them back names them again as fields to wire again, so you can see which wiring to re-run.

After `uloop compile` there is a second case: if the compile included the edit that added the
field, the field is a real compiled field now, and the wiring call says so instead of the message
above. Set it through the Inspector or as a normal field and delete the wiring script — the side
table is no longer involved.

### Entering play mode

What play mode costs depends on the project's Enter Play Mode Options.

| Setting | What survives | What to do |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Domain reload on (the default for projects created before Unity 6.6) | Nothing. `--status` reports `0 change(s) currently active` and says the changes were discarded when play mode was entered | Re-apply the hot reload, then re-run the wiring script — both work from inside play mode |
| Domain reload disabled (the default for new projects since Unity 6.6) | The declarations, and the values written through `SetInstanceField` when the host is a scene object or an asset and the value is a plain value, a scene object, or an asset. `--status` still lists the `Active` and `AddedField` rows. Some values that could not be restored are named by `--status` and by the `Warnings` of the next apply; the rest are not named (see below) | Wire again every value named as not restored, and the one unnamed case below |

Play mode builds the scene's objects again either way, and an added field on a new instance starts
at its initializer unless something gives the value back.

With domain reload on, nothing does. Wire the instance you are actually looking at.

With domain reload disabled, the first read of the field on the rebuilt object returns the value
wired into the object that sat in the same place: same scene, same names and sibling positions,
same component type and position, or the same asset. This works in both directions, entering and
leaving play mode, and it covers the reads Awake and OnEnable make while the scene loads.

These values are not restored and are named once, as `Type.field on <host>: <reason>`, in
`UnrestoredWiredValues` and `Warnings` of `--status` and in the `Warnings` of the next apply:

- a value that is an object created at run time, which no scene or asset holds;
- a value that is a scene object or asset that is gone, or no longer sits in the same place;
- a field whose first read on the rebuilt object happens off the main thread; a later read on
  the main thread, or wiring it again from the main thread, clears the row;
- a value whose host is no longer at its place after the reload, because it was renamed, moved,
  or removed (or a sibling before it was); the row names the old place, and the rebuilt object
  elsewhere starts at its initializer until the host is back at its place (the value then reaches
  it on its next read, or when the next `--status` or apply checks it again, and the row goes away) or you wire it again. The row goes away only for a
  host back at the old place, whether the value reached it or you wired it again there; wiring the
  value into an object at another place leaves the row, because the old wiring is still kept for
  that place. A host that exists only while play mode
  runs (an instantiated `(Clone)`, for example) is named once when play mode stops, with a reason
  saying so, and its value is then forgotten: wire it again in the next play session.

This value is not restored and is not named. The field silently starts at its initializer, so
notice it yourself and wire it again:

- a value the hot-reloaded code wrote itself instead of the wiring call.

`RestoredWiredValueCount` on `--status` counts the values that came back, including the ones
`--status` itself gave back by reading them for a host that is back at its place.
`--revert-all` forgets every wired value, so a field added again later starts at its initializer.

When the re-apply adds back fields the domain reload discarded, its `Warnings` names exactly those
fields: any value wired into them before the domain reload is gone, so wire them again before code
that reads them runs. A field the re-apply adds for the first time is not named, because it never
held a wired value, and each field is named once, by the first re-apply that adds it back.

### Wiring while play mode runs

While play mode runs, every frame can read an added field before you wire it, and code that
dereferences it fails every frame until then (a `NullReferenceException` per frame is typical).
When the response names fields to wire while play mode runs unpaused, its `Warnings` says so. Do
this instead:

1. `uloop control-play-mode --action Pause`, preferably before the hot reload.
2. Apply the hot reload if you have not yet, then run the wiring script.
3. `uloop control-play-mode --action Play` resumes from the pause.

No frame runs while play mode is paused, so the first read after resuming sees the wired value.
