name: uloop-hot-reload
toolName: hot-reload
description: "Hot reload applies method-body edits and can add new methods and fields (added members are visible to edited code in the same reload within the same assembly); it can also change signatures: a return-type change applies only when the same reload (or an earlier one) covers the old signature's compiled callers, while a rename or parameter change applies as an added method and warns about compiled callers it leaves on the old signature. New top-level types (class/struct/enum/interface/static helper) of the same assembly are introduced by the reload that declares them; other new-type shapes, use from another assembly or through Unity, asmdef changes, and members referenced from other assemblies or from files that are neither passed to the reload nor already hot-reloaded require 'uloop compile'."

# uloop hot-reload

Replaces method bodies in the running Editor (EditMode or PlayMode) directly from edited
project source files — no domain reload, no attributes, no source markers. Private/internal
member access, static methods, return values, async methods, and iterators all work within
the limits below, including private access inside async, iterator, lambda, local-function,
and LINQ-query bodies. Methods that cannot be patched are reported as `Skipped` or `Failed`;
one unpatchable method never aborts the rest of the run.

## Usage

```bash
uloop hot-reload --files Assets/Scripts/Enemy.cs
uloop hot-reload --files Assets/Scripts/Enemy.cs,Assets/Scripts/Boss.cs
uloop hot-reload
uloop hot-reload --files Assets/Scripts/Enemy.cs --compile-on-skip off
uloop hot-reload --revert-all
```

Multiple files are one comma-separated value (or a JSON array); array options
consume exactly one value token.

A script under a brand-new `.asmdef` cannot be hot-reloaded before its first import: Unity
has not created that assembly yet. Run `uloop compile` once, then iterate with hot reload.
A new file under an existing `.asmdef` can be hot-reloaded, but it is never selected
automatically — pass it with `--files`.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--files` | array | - | Project-relative `.cs` paths to hot-reload (method bodies, added members, and new top-level types). When omitted or empty on apply, selects compiled snapshot sources only — those whose bytes changed since the last compile snapshot, capped at 50 changed files per assembly with a warning when the cap trims the list; a file that has never been compiled is never selected and must be passed explicitly, except an introduced type's file after Play Mode entry or `--revert-all`, which is selected again; run `uloop compile` first when no snapshot exists, or pass explicit paths when no changed source is found |
| `--revert-all` | flag | - | Remove every active hot-reload patch and added member and clear the ledger; introduced types stay loaded until the next domain reload. When set, `--files` is ignored |
| `--status` | flag | - | Lists the currently active changes (patched methods, added members, and introduced types) without applying or reverting anything. |
| `--compile-on-skip` | enum | `auto` | When edits stay unapplied (Skipped/Failed methods, Failed types; a re-bound sibling's Skipped rows aside), run `uloop compile` in this command: `auto` only in Edit Mode (never stops a Play session), `on` always unless Unity holds compiles until Play ends, `off` never. The response's `CompileFallback` says which; when the compile ran, `Compile` carries its result and `Success` is the compile's. |

## Status

`uloop hot-reload --status` lists the currently active changes; it cannot be combined with
`--files` or `--revert-all`. Every change is static Editor state, so after a domain reload
it reports zero. Each `Active`/`Added` row's `InvocationCount` counts calls
into its body since it was applied — a reachability signal only while the code is
being driven.

## How It Works

The edited files are grouped by the compiled assembly they belong to. Per group an
out-of-process Roslyn worker rewrites every editable body into a static shim, the shims
compile into one shim assembly and load into the Editor domain, and each original method is
patched with a Harmony transpiler. Because a group shares one shim assembly, a body edited in
one file can call a member added in another edited file of the same assembly. Re-running after
a real edit replaces the patch; an unchanged file reports `AlreadyActive` and changes nothing
unless a sibling of the same assembly is in the reload, in which case it is re-applied so every
active patch binds to the newest shim. With a compile-time baseline only bodies that actually
changed are patched (`UnchangedTotal` counts the rest).

## Scope in Brief

- Patched: ordinary method bodies and property getters with a body.
- Added members: new methods, fields, and supported properties apply as `Added` rows,
  visible to edited code of the same reload within the same assembly (pass the declaring
  file and its callers together), and gone on any compile or domain reload.
- New types: a top-level class, struct, enum, or interface declared in an edited
  file is introduced by that reload and listed in `IntroducedTypes`; other valid shapes are
  refused with a `Warnings` line naming the reason. Use from another assembly or from files
  outside the reload, reflection, serialization, and Unity message discovery still need
  `uloop compile`.
- Signature changes: a return-type change is `Skipped` unless this or an earlier reload
  patched every live compiled caller, none in another assembly; a rename or parameter change
  applies as an added method and warns about call sites left on the old signature.
- Constructors, operators, struct methods, compiled setter/init/indexer accessors, and event
  accessors are `Skipped`; finalizers and interface members are silently not applied.
- A reload applies each file all-or-nothing: a `Failed` method leaves that file unapplied,
  a `Failed` type leaves every file of its assembly unapplied.

## Workflow

Treat hot reload as the exploration phase and `uloop compile` as the landing phase:
keep edits inside the edited files, collect structural changes, and compile once —
every compile drops all patches and pause points and resets the PlayMode session (the compile response's Warning says how many).
While hot-reload changes are active, `AutoRefreshHeld` is true so returning focus does not
recompile; `uloop compile` releases the hold, and `--revert-all` only when no introduced type
remains.
One-shot methods (`Awake`, `Start`, init helpers) patch but show no effect on the call that
already ran; the response marks them with `LifecycleNote`.
To tune a value while playing, expose a static property getter instead of a `const`; its
body is patched on compiled and introduced types alike.

## Reference Guides

All files live in `references/` beside this skill; read the one whose trigger matches:

- `references/scope-and-limits.md` — full scope rules: added members, signature changes, `Skipped`/`Failed` tables, source baselines, one-shot code, tunable getters.
- `references/mechanism-and-lifecycle.md` — patch mechanism, convergence, what survives which reload, Editor-code iteration without PlayMode.
- `references/troubleshooting.md` — `Patched` but no behavior change, JIT inlining, `--status`, stack frames without lines.
- `references/pause-point-interaction.md` — how patches re-target or suppress armed pause points; one-way reachability checks.
- `references/introduced-types.md` — types a reload can introduce: supported shapes, internal access, refusal wording, identity and lifetime, why a new file is never selected automatically.
- `references/added-field-wiring.md` — putting a value into an added field without a compile.
- `references/output.md` — every response field: `ErrorCode`, `NextActions`, `Methods` rows, `Warnings`, totals.
